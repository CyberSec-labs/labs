# Lab 2 - Ransomware and Encryption Lab
This lab has three parts to it.

You are given R1.py, R2.py, and R3.py.

These are ransomware files, that, when run will encrypt all the files in it's directory. 

## Question 1
For question 1, locate the following files in the `lab-input/Q1` subdirectory:

 - R1.py
 - Encrypted1.txt
 - Encrypted1_token.txt

R1.py is the first iteration of the ransomware file. It features no obfuscation, and should be relatively easy to reverse. Your task is to reverse engineer the program and write a decryption program to decrypt Encrypted1.txt

## Question 2
For question 2, locate the following files in the `lab-input/Q1` subdirectory:

 - R2.py
 - Encrypted2.txt
 - Encrypted2_token.txt

R2.py is the second iteration of the ransomware file. It features light obfuscation, and should be more challenging to reverse. You need to do the same thing and write a decryption program and decrypt D2.txt. Drag Encrypted2.txt into your solutions folder.
## Question 3
For question 3, locate the following files in the `lab-input/Q1` subdirectory:

 - R3.py
 - Encrypted3.txt
 - Encrypted3_token.txt

R3.py is the third iteration of the ransomware file. It is the most challenging to reverse. You need to do the same thing and write a decryption program and decrypt D3.txt. Drag Encrypted3.txt into your solutions folder.
